# Man-Reborn
Inspired from the meme of a nonexistent game, Man: The Game

Man: Reborn is a spinoff on another universe about parallel universes.

The story revolves around Man's bizzare adventures with his parallel selves. The story starts off Man complaining his boring life until another Man from another universe, severely wounded, came to Man's universe in hopes of finding the best man to fight off the multiversal war started by Evil Man. 

"I want Man: Reborn to be Baldur's Gate and Zelda-inspired 2d Adventure RPG game with inspiration from Omori. Basically Rick and Morty style parallel universe shit." - Creator, Man: Reborn
